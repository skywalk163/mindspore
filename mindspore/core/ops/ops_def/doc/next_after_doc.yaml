        Returns the next representable floating-point value after `input` towards `other` element-wise.

        Say there are two float32 numbers :math:`a`, :math:`b`, and let the
        representable delta of float32 datatype is :math:`eps`. If :math:`a < b`,
        then the next representable of :math:`a` towards :math:`b` is :math:`a+eps`,
        the next representable of :math:`b` towards :math:`a` is :math:`b-eps`.

            out_{i} =  nextafter({input_{i}, other_{i}})

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The first input tensor. The shape of tensor is :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means,
                any number of additional dimensions. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64.
    
            other (Tensor): The second input tensor. The shape of tensor is :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means,
                any number of additional dimensions. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64.
    
        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape and data type as `input`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If neither `input` nor `other` is a Tensor.
            TypeError: If the dtype of `input` and `other` is not one of: float32, float64.
            TypeError: If the dtypes of `input` and `other` are not same.
            ValueError: If `input`'s shape is not the same as `other`.
