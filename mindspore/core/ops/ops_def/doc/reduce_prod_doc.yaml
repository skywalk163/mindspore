reduce_prod:
    description: |
        Reduces a dimension of a tensor by multiplying all elements in the dimension, by default. And also can
        reduce a dimension of `x` along the `axis`. Determine whether the dimensions of the output and input are the
        same by controlling `keep_dims`.

        Note:
            The `axis` with tensor type is only used for compatibility with older versions and is not recommended.

        Args:
            keep_dims (bool): If ``True`` , keep these reduced dimensions and the length is 1.
                If ``False`` , don't keep these dimensions. Default: ``False`` .

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Tensor[Number]) - The input tensor.
            - **axis** (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int), Tensor]) - The dimensions to reduce. Default: ``()`` ,
              reduce all dimensions. Only constant value is allowed. Must be in the range [-r, r).

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same dtype as the `x`.

            - If `axis` is ``()`` , and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the output is a 0-D tensor representing the product of all elements in the input tensor.
            - If `axis` is int, set as 1, and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
            - If `axis` is tuple(int), set as (1, 2), and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
            - If `axis` is 1-D Tensor, set as [1, 2], and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `keep_dims` is not a bool.
            TypeError: If `x` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If `axis` is not one of the following: int, tuple, list or Tensor.
            ValueError: If `axis` is out of range.
