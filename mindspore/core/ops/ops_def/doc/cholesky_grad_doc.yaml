cholesky_grad:
    description: |
        Computes the reverse mode backpropgated gradient of the Cholesky algorithm.

        Args:
            - **x** (Tensor) - A tensor with float32 or float64 data type.
            - **grad** (Tensor) - A tensor with float32 or float64 data type. `grad` should have
              the same dtype with `x`.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same dtype as `a` and `x`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If x is not Tensor.
            TypeError: If grad is not Tensor.
            TypeError: If dtype of input x and grad is not float64 nor float32,
            TypeError: If x has different dtype with grad.
            ValueError: If input tensor's last two dims are not equal,
            ValueError: If the shape of x and grad mismatch.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``
