conj:
    description: |
        Returns a tensor of complex numbers that are the complex conjugate of each element in input.
        The complex numbers in input must be of the form a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
    
        The complex conjugate returned by this operation is of the form a - bj.
    
        If `input` is real, it is returned unchanged.
    
        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input tensor to compute to. Must have numeric type.
    
        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same dtype as the `input`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If the dtype of `input` is not a numeric type.
            TypeError: If the `input` is not a Tensor.

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.asarray(np.complex(1.3+0.4j)), mindspore.complex64)
            >>> output = ops.conj(x)
            >>> print(output)
            (1.3-0.4j)
