ones_like:
    description: |
        Returns a Tensor with a value of 1 and its shape and data type is the same as the input.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.ones_like` for more details.

        Inputs:
            - **input_x** (Tensor) - Tensor of any dimension.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same shape and type as `input_x` but filled with ones.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input_x = Tensor(np.array([[0, 1], [2, 1]]).astype(np.int32))
            >>> output = ops.OnesLike()(input_x)
            >>> print(output)
            [[1 1]
            [1 1]]
