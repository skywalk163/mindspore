resize_bilinear_grad:
  description: |
    Performs grad of ResizeBilinear operation.
    
    Args:
        grads (Tensor): A 4-D Tensor with shape [batch, channel, height, width].
        image (Tensor): A 4-D Tensor with shape [batch, channel, height, width], The origin image tensor that was resized.
        align_corners (bool): If true, the centers of the 4 corner pixels of the input and output tensors are 
            aligned, preserving the values at the corner pixels.Default: ``False``.
        half_pixel_centers (bool): An optional bool. Default: ``False``.

    Outputs:
        A 4-D Tensor , with the same shape and data type as `image`.
