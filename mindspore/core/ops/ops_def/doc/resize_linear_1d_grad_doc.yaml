  description: |
    Compute gradient of `ResizeLinear1D` operator.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change.

    Args:
        grads (Tensor): A Tensor of type float. 3-D with shape [batch, channel, width].
        x (Tensor): A origin input Tensor. 3-D with shape [batch, channel, orig_width], The origin tensor that was resized.
        coordinate_transformation_mode (string): Default is 'align_corners'. Describes how to transform the coordinate
            in the resized tensor to the coordinate in the original tensor. Other optional: 'half_pixel'.
