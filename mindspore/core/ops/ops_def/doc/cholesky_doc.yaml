cholesky:
    description: |
        Performs the Cholesky decomposition on a single or a batch of symmetric positive-definite matrices.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.cholesky` for more details.

        Args:
            upper (bool, optional): Flag that indicates whether to return a upper or lower triangular matrix.
                Default: ``False`` .

        Inputs:
            - **input_x**  (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(*, N, N)`, where :math:`*` is zero or more batch dimensions
              consisting of symmetric positive-definite matrices, with float32 or float64 data type.
        
        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same shape and data type as `input_x`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input_x = Tensor(np.array([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 2.0]]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = ops.Cholesky()(input_x)
            >>> print(output)
            [[1. 0.]
             [1. 1.]]
