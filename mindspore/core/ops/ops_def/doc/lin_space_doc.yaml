lin_space:
    description: |
        Returns a Tensor whose value is `num` evenly spaced in the interval `start` and `stop` (including `start` and
        `stop`), and the length of the output Tensor is `num`.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.linspace` for more details.

        Inputs:
            - **start** (Tensor) -  Start value of interval, 0-D Tensor with dtype float32 or float64.
            - **stop** (Tensor) - Last value of interval, 0-D Tensor with dtype float32 or float64.
            - **num** (Union[int, Tensor]) - Number of ticks in the interval, inclusive of `start` and `stop`.
              Must be a positive integer. When the input is Tensor, it must be a 0-D Tensor with dtype int32 or int64.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same shape and dtype as `start`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> start = Tensor(1, mindspore.float32)
            >>> stop = Tensor(10, mindspore.float32)
            >>> num = 5
            >>> output = ops.LinSpace()(start, stop, num)
            >>> print(output)
            [ 1.    3.25  5.5   7.75 10.  ]
