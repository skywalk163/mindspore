hshrink_grad:
    description: |
        Computes gradients for HShrinkGrad operation.

        Args:
            Gradients (Tensor) - the gradients of loss to output of HShrink function.
            Currently gradients data type only support float16 and float32.
            Features (Tensor) - Must be the input `input_x` of the forward operator HSHrink.
            Currently features data type only support float16 and float32.
            lambd (float): the lambda value for the Hardshrink formulation. Default: 0.5

        Returns:
            backprops - Tensor, with the same shape and data type as `features`.

        Rasise:
            ValueError: If `lambd` is not a float.
            ValueError: If shape of `gradients` is not the same as `features`.
            TypeError: If dtype of `gradients` is not the same as `features`.
            TypeError: If dtype of `gradients` or `features` is neither float16 nor float32.
