        Returns the element-wise argument of a complex tensor.
        The elements in input are considered to be complex numbers of the form a+bj, where a is the real part and b
        is the imaginary part. The argument returned by this function is of the form :math:`atan2(b, a)`.

        Args:
          input (Tensor):
            The input tensor. types: complex64, complex128.

        Returns:
          Tensor, has the float32 or float64 type and the same shape as input.

        Raises:
          TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
          TypeError:
            If the dtype of `input` is not one of: complex64, complex128.

        Supported Platforms:
          ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
          >>> import mindspore
          >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
          >>> input = Tensor([-1.5 + 7.8j, 3 + 5.75j], mindspore.complex64)
          >>> output = ops.angle(input)
          >>> print(output)
