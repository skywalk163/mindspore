real:
    description: |
        Returns a Tensor that is the real part of the input. If input is real, it is returned unchanged.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input tensor to compute to.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the input.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If input is not a Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore as ms
            >>> import mindspore.ops as ops
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> input = ms.Tensor(np.asarray(np.complex(1.3+0.4j)), ms.complex64)
            >>> output = ops.real(input)
            >>> print(output)
            1.3
