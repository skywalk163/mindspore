        Reshape the tensor according to the input shape. It's the same as :func:`mindspore.Tensor.reshape`,
        implemented by the underlying reshape operator.

        Args:
            shape (Union[tuple(int), int]): Dimension of the output tensor.

        Returns:
            Tensor, which dimension is the input shape's value.

        Examples:
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> a = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]], dtype=np.float32))
            >>> output = a.view((3, 2))
            >>> print(output)
            [[1. 2.]
            [3. 2.]
            [3. 4.]]
