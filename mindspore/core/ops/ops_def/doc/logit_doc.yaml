logit:
    description: |
        Calculate the logit of a tensor element-wise. Element in `x` is clamped to [eps, 1-eps].

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.logit` for more details.

        Args:
            eps (float, optional): The epsilon. The input clamp bound is defined as [eps, 1-eps]. Default: ``-1.0`` .

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Tensor) - The input tensor of type float16, float32 or float64.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, with the same shape and dtype as the `x`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> op = ops.Logit(eps=1e-5)
            >>> output = op(x)
            >>> print(output)
