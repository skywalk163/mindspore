contiguous:
    description: |
        Converts a Tensor into a continuous-memory Tensor that contains the same data as the original Tensor.

        Returns:
            A contiguous in memory tensor containing the same data as self tensor.

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore as ms
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=ms.float32)
            >>> y = ops.transpose(x, (1, 0))
            >>> y.contiguous()
            >>> y[:, 1] = 1
            >>> print(x)
            [[1. 2. 3.]
             [4. 5. 6.]]
