matrix_determinant:
    description: |   
        Calculates the value of the determinant for one or more square matrices.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.det` for more details.

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Tensor) - A matrix to be calculated. The matrix must be at least two dimensions, and the last two
            dimensions must be the same size.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, the shape is `x_shape[:-2]`, the dtype is same as `x`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> input_x = Tensor(np.array([[[-4.5, -1.5], [7.0, 6.0]], [[2.5, 0.5], [3.0, 9.0]]]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> op = ops.MatrixDeterminant()
            >>> output = op(input_x)
            >>> print(output)
            [-16.5 21. ]
