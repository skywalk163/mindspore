avg_pool:
  description: |
    Average pooling operation.

    Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.avg_pool2d` for more details.

    Args:
        kernel_size (Union[int, tuple[int]]): The size of kernel used to take the average value,
            is an int number that represents height and width of the kernel, or a tuple
            of two int numbers that represent height and width respectively. Default: ``1`` .
        strides (Union[int, tuple[int]]): The distance of kernel moving, an int number that represents
            the height and width of movement are both strides, or a tuple of two int numbers that
            represent height and width of movement respectively. Default: ``1`` .
        pad_mode (str, optional): Specifies the padding mode with a padding value of 0. It can be set to:
            ``"SAME"`` or ``"VALID"`` . Default: ``"VALID"`` .

            - ``"SAME"``: Pad the input around its edges so that the shape of input and output
              are the same when `stride` is set to ``1``.
              The amount of padding to is calculated by the operator internally, If the amount is even, it is
              uniformly distributed around the input, if it is odd, the excess amount goes to the right/bottom side.
            - ``"valid"``: No padding is applied to the input, and the output returns the maximum
              possible height and width. Extra pixels that could not complete a full stride will
              be discarded.

        data_format (str, optional): The format of input and output data. It should be ``'NHWC'`` or ``'NCHW'`` .
            Default: ``'NCHW'`` .

    Inputs:
        - **x** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`.
          Supported dtypes: float16, float32, float64.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, with shape :math:`(N, C_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `kernel_size` or `strides` is neither int nor tuple.
        TypeError: If dtype of `x` is not  float16, float32 or float64.
        ValueError: If `kernel_size` or `strides` is less than 1.
        ValueError: If `pad_mode` is neither 'valid' nor 'same' with not case sensitive.
        ValueError: If `data_format` is neither 'NCHW' nor 'NHWC'.
        ValueError: If length of shape of `x` is not equal to 4.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
