        Gradients of PReLU operation.

        Note:
            1-dimensional input_x is not supported.

        Inputs:
            - **dy** (Tensor) - Representing the backprop of the next layer.
            - **x** (Tensor) - Must be the input `x` of forward operator PRelu.
            - **weight** (Tensor) - Float Tensor, w > 0, must be the input `weight` of forward operator PRelu.

        Outputs:
            - **dx** (Tensor), with the same type as `x`.
            - **dw** (Tensor), with the same type as `weight`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
