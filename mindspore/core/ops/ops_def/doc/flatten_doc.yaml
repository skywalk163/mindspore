flatten:
  description: |
    Flattens a tensor without changing its batch size on the 0-th axis.

    Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.flatten` for more details.

    Inputs:
        - **input_x** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, \ldots)` to be flattened, where :math:`N` is batch size.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, the shape of the output tensor is :math:`(N, X)`, where :math:`X` is
        the product of the remaining dimension.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input_x = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[1, 2, 3, 4]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> flatten = ops.Flatten()
        >>> output = flatten(input_x)
        >>> print(output.shape)
        (1, 24)
