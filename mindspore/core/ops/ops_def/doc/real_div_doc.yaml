real_div:
    description: |
        Divides the first input tensor by the second input tensor in floating-point type element-wise.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.div` for more details.
    
        Inputs:
            - **x** (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]) - The first input is a number or
              a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
            - **y** (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]) - The second input is a number or
              a bool when the first input is a tensor or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
    
        Outputs:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
            and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.
    
        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> realdiv = ops.RealDiv()
            >>> output = realdiv(x, y)
            >>> print(output)
            [0.25 0.4  0.5 ]
