resize_bicubic_grad:
    description: |
        Computes gradients for ResizeBicubicGrad operation.

        Args:
            grads (Tensor): A Tensor of type float. 4-D with shape [batch, height, width, channels]. The format must be NHWC.
            image (Tensor): A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float, double.
                4-D with shape [batch, orig_height, orig_width, channels], The origin image tensor that was resized.
                The format must be NHWC.
            align_corners (bool): If true, the centers of the 4 corner pixels of the input and output tensors are 
                aligned, preserving the values at the corner pixels.Default: ``False``.
            half_pixel_centers (bool): An optional bool. Default: ``False``.

        Outputs:
            A 4-D Tensor , with the same shape and data type as `image`.

        Rasise:
            TypeError: If `grads` is not allowed.
            TypeError: If `image` is not allowed.
            ValueError: If `image` dim is not 4.
            ValueError: If `size` dim is not 4.
