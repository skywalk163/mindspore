    description: |
        Hard Shrink activation function.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.hardshrink` for more details.

        Args:
            lambd (float, optional): The threshold :math:`\lambda` defined by the Hard Shrink formula. Default: ``0.5`` .

        Inputs:
            - **input_x** (Tensor) - The input of Hard Shrink with data type of float16 or float32.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, the same shape and data type as the input.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore as ms
            >>> import mindspore.ops as ops
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, nn
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> input_x = Tensor(np.array([[0.5,  1,  2.0], [0.0533, 0.0776, -2.1233]]), ms.float32)
            >>> hshrink = ops.HShrink()
            >>> output = hshrink(input_x)
            >>> print(output)
            [[ 0.      1.      2.    ]
            [ 0.      0.     -2.1233]]
