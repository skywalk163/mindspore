rsqrt:
    description: |
        Computes reciprocal of square root of input tensor element-wise.

        .. math::
        
            out_{i} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{input_{i}}}
    
        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input of rsqrt. Its each element must be a non-negative
                number, if an element is negative, the calculation result is nan.
    
        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape and dtype as the `input`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
    
        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore as ms
            >>> import mindspore.ops as ops
            >>> input = ms.Tensor([-0.0370,  0.2970,  1.5420, -0.9105])
            >>> output = ops.rsqrt(input)
            >>> print(output)
