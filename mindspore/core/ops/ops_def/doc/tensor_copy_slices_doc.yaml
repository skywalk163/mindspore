tensor_copy_slices:
    description: |
        Copy continues memory.

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Tensor) - The target Tensor.
            - **value** (Tensor) - The tensor to update x.
            - **begin** (tuple[int]) - A tuple which represents the location where to start. Only
              constant value is allowed.
            - **end** (tuple[int]) - A tuple or which represents the maximum location where to end.
              Only constant value is allowed.
            - **strides** (tuple[int]) - A tuple which represents the stride is continuously added
              before reaching the maximum location. Only constant value is allowed.
    
        Outputs:
            - **y** (Tensor), has the same shape and data type of x.
    
        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore.ops.operations import _inner_ops
            >>> copy_slices = _inner_ops.TensorCopySlices()
            >>> out = copy_slices(Tensor(np.zeros((5, 5))), Tensor(np.ones((2, 5))), (3, 0), (5, 5), (1, 1))
            >>> print(out)
