def matmul(x1, x2, dtype=None):
    """
    Returns the matrix product of two arrays.

    Note:
        Numpy arguments `out`, `casting`, `order`, `subok`, `signature`, and `extobj` are
        not supported.
        On GPU, the supported dtypes are np.float16 and np.float32.
        On CPU, the supported dtypes are np.float16 and np.float32.

    Args:
        x1 (Tensor): Input tensor, scalar not allowed.
          The last dimension of `x1` must be the same size as the second last dimension of `x2`.
          And the shape of x1 and x2 could be broadcast.
        x2 (Tensor): Input tensor, scalar not allowed.
          The last dimension of `x1` must be the same size as the second last dimension of `x2`.
          And the shape of x1 and x2 could be broadcast.
        dtype (:class:`mindspore.dtype`, optional): defaults to None. Overrides the dtype of the
            output Tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor or scalar, the matrix product of the inputs. This is a scalar only
        when both `x1`, `x2` are 1-d vectors.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the last dimension of `x1` is not the same size as the
            second-to-last dimension of `x2`, or if a scalar value is passed in.
        ValueError: If the shape of `x1` and `x2` could not broadcast together.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

def mm(input, mat2):
    r"""
    Returns the matrix product of two arrays.
    If `input` is a :math:`(n \times m)` Tensor, `mat2` is a
    :math:`(m \times p)` Tensor, `out` will be a :math:`(n \times p)` Tensor.

    Note:
        - This function cannot support broadcasting.
          Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.matmul` instead if you need a broadcastable function.
        - On Ascend, float64 doesn't be supported.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): The first matrix of matrix multiplication.
            The last dimension of `input` must be the same size as the first dimension of `mat2`.
        mat2 (Tensor): The second matrix of matrix multiplication.
            The last dimension of `input` must be the same size as the first dimension of `mat2`.

    Returns:
        Tensor or scalar, the matrix product of the inputs.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the last dimension of `input` is not the same size as the
            second-to-last dimension of `mat2`.
        ValueError: If `input` or `mat2` is not a Tensor.
