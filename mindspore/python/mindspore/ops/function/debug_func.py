def print_(*input_x):
    """
    Outputs the inputs to stdout. The outputs are printed to screen by default.
    It can also be saved in a file by setting the parameter  `print_file_path` in `context`.
    Once set, the output will be saved in the file specified by print_file_path.
    :func:`mindspore.parse_print` can be employed to reload the data.
    For more information, please refer to :func:`mindspore.set_context` and :func:`mindspore.parse_print`.

    Note:
        In pynative mode, please use python print function.
        In Ascend platform with graph mode, the bool, int and float would be converted into Tensor to print, and
        str remains unchanged.
        This function is used for debugging.

    Args:
        input_x (Union[Tensor, bool, int, float, str, tuple, list]): The inputs of print_.
            Supports multiple inputs which are separated by ','.

    Returns:
        Invalid value, should be ignored.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input_x` is not one of the following: Tensor, bool, int, float, str, tuple or list.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> x = Tensor(np.ones([2, 1]).astype(np.int32))
        >>> y = Tensor(np.ones([2, 2]).astype(np.int32))
        >>> result = ops.print_('Print Tensor x and Tensor y:', x, y)
        Print Tensor x and Tensor y:
        Tensor(shape=[2, 1], dtype=Int32, value=
        [[1],
         [1]])
        Tensor(shape=[2, 2], dtype=Int32, value=
        [[1, 1],
         [1, 1]])
