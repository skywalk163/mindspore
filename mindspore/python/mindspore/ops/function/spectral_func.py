def blackman_window(window_length, periodic=True, *, dtype=None):
    r"""
    Blackman window function, usually used to extract finite signal segment for FFT.

    The `window_length` is a input tensor which determines the returned window size, and its data should be
    an integer. In particular, if `window_length` is equal to `1`, only a single value `1` exists in the
    returned window.

    Attr `periodic` determines whether the returned window removes the last duplicate value
    from the symmetric window and prepares to be a periodic window with functions.
    Therefore, if attr `periodic` is true, the :math:`N` in formula is :math:`window\_length + 1`.

    .. math::

        w[n] = 0.42 - 0.5 cos(\frac{2\pi n}{N - 1}) + 0.08 cos(\frac{4\pi n}{N - 1})

    where :math:`N` is the full window size, and n is natural number less than :math:`N` :[0, 1, ..., N-1].

    Args:
        window_length (Tensor): The size of returned window, with data type int32, int64.
            The input data should be an integer with a value of [0, 1000000].
        periodic (bool, optional): Indicates whether to returns a window to be used as periodic function or
            a symmetric window. Default: ``True`` .

    Keyword Args:
        dtype (mindspore.dtype, optional): The data type of returned tensor.
            Only float16, float32 and float64 is allowed. Default: ``None`` .

    Returns:
        A 1-D tensor of size `window_length` containing the window. Its datatype is set by the attr `dtype`.
        If 'dtype' is None, output datatype is float32.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `window_length` is not a Tensor.
        TypeError: If `periodic` is not a bool.
        TypeError: If `dtype` is not one of: float16, float32, float64.
        TypeError: If the type of `window_length` is not one of: int32, int64.
        ValueError: If the value range of `window_length` is not [0, 1000000].
        ValueError: If the dimension of `window_length` is not 0.
