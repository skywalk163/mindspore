"""
This module is to support audio augmentations.
It includes two parts: audio transforms and utils.
audio transforms is a high performance processing module with common audio operations.
utils provides some general methods for audio processing.

Common imported modules in corresponding API examples are as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    import mindspore.dataset.audio as audio
    from mindspore.dataset.audio import utils

Alternative and equivalent imported audio module is as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset.audio.transforms as audio

Descriptions of common data processing terms are as follows:

- TensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in C++.
- AudioTensorOperation, the base class of all audio processing operations. It is a derived class of TensorOperation.

The data transform operation can be executed in the data processing pipeline or in the eager mode:

- Pipeline mode is generally used to process big datasets. Examples refer to
  `introduction to data processing pipeline <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/
  mindspore.dataset.html#introduction-to-data-processing-pipeline>`_ .
- Eager mode is more like a function call to process data. Examples refer to
  `Lightweight Data Processing <https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/advanced/dataset/eager.html>`_ .
