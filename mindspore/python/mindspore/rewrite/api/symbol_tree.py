    The statements in the network are saved in the SymbolTree in the form of nodes, and by processing
    the nodes in the SymbolTree, you can delete the network code, insert and replace it, and get the
    modified network code and network instances.

    Args:
        handler (SymbolTreeImpl): SymbolTree internal implementation instance. It is recommended to call the `create`
            method in SymbolTree to create a SymbolTree, rather than calling SymbolTree's constructor directly.

    def create(cls, network):
        """
        Create a SymbolTree object by passing in the network instance `network`.

        This interface parses the `network` instance, expands each source
        code statement of the forward computation process, and parses it into nodes,
        which is stored in the SymbolTree. The specific process is as follows:

        1. Obtain the source code of the network instance.
        2. Perform AST parsing on the network and obtain the AST nodes (abstract syntax trees) of each
           statement in the network.
        3. Expand complex statements in the network forward evaluation process into multiple simple statements.
        4. Create a SymbolTree object. Each SymbolTree corresponds to one network instance.
        5. Use the rewrite node to store each statement of the network forward computation process. The node records
           the input, output, and other information of the statement.
        6. Save the rewrite node to the SymbolTree, and update and maintain the topological connection between
           the nodes.
        7. Return the SymbolTree object corresponding to the network instance.

        If a user-defined network of type :class:`mindspore.nn.Cell` is called in the forward computation process
        of the network, rewrite will generate a node of type `NodeType.Tree` for the corresponding statement. This
        type of node stores a new SymbolTree, which parses and maintains the node information of the user-defined
        network.

        If the following types of statements are called in the forward computation process of the network, rewrite
        will parse the internal statements in the statement and generate corresponding nodes:

        - :class:`mindspore.nn.SequentialCell`
        - Functions(Excludes Python built-in functions and third-party library functions)
        - Control flow statements, such as `if` statements

        Note:
            Because the specific execution branch of control flows are still unknown during the rewrite operation
            of the network, no topology information will be established between the nodes inside the control flow
            and the nodes outside.
            Users cannot obtain nodes inside the control flow when they acquire nodes outside the control flow using
            interfaces like :func:`mindspore.rewrite.Node.get_inputs` and :func:`mindspore.rewrite.Node.get_users` .
            Users also cannot obtain nodes outside the control flow, if they use these interfaces inside the control
            flow.
            Therefore, when users modify the network, they need to manually handle the node information inside and
            outside the control flow.

        The current rewrite module has the following syntax limitations:

        - Only networks of type :class:`mindspore.nn.Cell` are supported as input to the rewrite module.
        - Parsing one-line control flow syntax(e.g. one-line if-else, one-line for loop) is not currently supported.
        - Parsing decorator syntax is not currently supported.
        - Parsing local classes and embedded classes is not currently supported, that is, the definition
          of classes need to be placed on the outermost layer.
        - Parsing closure syntax is not currently supported, that is, the definition of out-of-class
          functions need to be placed at the outermost layer.
        - Parsing lambda expression syntax is not currently supported.
        - Parsing global variables is not currently supported, that is, global variables need to be converted to
          class variables or local variables before they can be used.
        - Parsing methods in the parent classes is not currently supported.

        For statements that do not support parsing, rewrite will generate nodes of type `NodeType.Python`
        for corresponding statements to ensure that the network after rewrite can run normally.
        The `Python` node does not support modifying the input and output of statements, and there may be
        a problem between variable names and those generated by the rewrite. In this case, users need to
        adjust the variable names manually.

            - Due to the data association between the new network and the original network instance, manually creating
              a network instance using the source code file generated by rewrite is not currently supported.

        Returns:
            A network object generated from SymbolTree.

        Examples:
            >>> from mindspore.rewrite import SymbolTree
            >>> # Define the network structure of LeNet5. Refer to
            >>> # https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/docs/mindspore/code/lenet.py
            >>> net = LeNet5()
            >>> stree = SymbolTree.create(net)
            >>> new_net = stree.get_network()
