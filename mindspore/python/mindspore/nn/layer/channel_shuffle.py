class ChannelShuffle(Cell):
    r"""
    Divide the channels of Tensor whose shape is :math:`(*, C, H, W)` into :math:`g` groups to obtain a Tensor with
    shape :math:`(*, C \frac g, g, H, W)`, and transpose along the corresponding axis of :math:`C`,
    :math:`\frac{g}{}` and :math:`g` to restore Tensor to the original shape.

    Args:
        groups (int): Number of groups to divide channels in, must be greater than 0.
            Refer to :math:`g` in the above formula.

    Inputs:
        - **x** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(*, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, with the same type and shape as the `x`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `groups` is not a positive integer.
        ValueError: If `groups` is less than 1.
        ValueError: If dims of `x` is less than 3.
        ValueError: If number of channels can not be divisible by groups.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> channel_shuffle = ms.nn.ChannelShuffle(2)
        >>> x = ms.Tensor(np.arange(16).astype(np.int32).reshape(1, 4, 2, 2))
        >>> print(x)
